Everything hurts like hell but, you're still alive, glad not to become another statistic in the city's rising murder rates. A quick scan reveals that you're the only one still in the realm of the living. Your entire fucking crew is deadâ€”flatlined by lethal injections of high-speed lead, courtesy of the finest private soldiers money can buy.",

The first place you head to is the bar where all this began. If anyone has answers, then it must be Fat Freddy.",
